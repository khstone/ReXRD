# ReXRD
Python script for calculating the resonant diffraction response of a powder for a given structure. 
The script can parse a simple CIF file to extract a structure and then calculate the response of 
specified Bragg peaks across a given x-ray energy range.  Averages over equivalent or overlapped 
peaks as appropriate for powder diffraction are made.
